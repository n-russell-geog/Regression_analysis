# Regression_analysis
This repository contains an R script I wrote to run and assess a series of linear regressions to invesitge whether there is a relationship between LEED buildings and gentrification in Denver.
The goal of this analysis was to see whether the rate of LEED buildings in a census tract predicts any change in seven gentrification indicator variables.
Each variable was run as an individual model as their are multiple dependent variables and just one independent variable (The LEED building rate is the independent variable and each of the indicators are independent variables).
The file also includes code used to produce plots to run diagnostics on the significant regression models.
